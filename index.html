                <p>
                    In Cosmology, we are often interested in understanding the spatial correlations amongst fluctuations
                    of various kinds. Of particular importance are two-point correlation functions of the form \(\langle
                    \phi(\bfx)\phi(\bfy)\rangle\) where \(\phi(\bfx)\) is some scalar quantity, say a temperature
                    fluctuation.
                </p>


                <p>
                    Because of the homogeneous and isotropic nature of spatial slices, it’s convenient to discuss the
                    Fourier transform of the correlator which takes on the form
                    \(\langle\phi_{\bfk}\phi_{-\bfk}\rangle'=P(k)\) where the power spectrum, \(P(k)\), only depends on
                    the magnitude of \(\bfk\), as indicated (see below for more on the notation).
                </p>

                <p>
                    All of the physics of the two-point function is encoded in \(P(k)\) and hence it’s typically the
                    quantity we focus on. However, if handed a \(P(k)\), it’s not very easy to visualize what a
                    corresponding spatial map of fluctuations would look like. In order to gain intuition for the power
                    spectrum and to understand how the fluctuations change as \(P(k)\) is altered, it’s nice to be able
                    to go from a given power spectrum to some concrete position space maps whose statistics realize a
                    given power spectrum.

                <p class="black-border">
                    <b>In this post we answer the following question:</b> <em> if we’re handed a \(P(k)\) which
                        describes a Gaussian random field, how do we generate a simple fluctuation map which has the
                        correlations described by this power spectrum?</em>
                </p>


                <p>
                    We start by reviewing some of the theory behind random Gaussian fields, which I found difficult to
                    find in any one place in the literature, and then move on to the practical construction of our maps
                    using <em>Mathematica</em>. A sample notebook is included at the end of the post. The methods used
                    for constructing the realization are by no means optimal; our goal is just to understand a quick and
                    dirty method of generating realizations.

                <p>
                    We start by reviewing the necessary theory background.
                </p>

                <h3> Correlators </h3>

                <p>
                    First, we set notation and review basic facts about equal time correlators of scalar quantities. We
                    focus only on two-point functions.
                </p>


                <p>
                    A homogeneous, isotropic position space two-point corrrelator only depends on the magnitude of the
                    distance between the points of interest: \(\langle \phi(\bfx)\phi(\bfy)\rangle=A(|\bfx-\bfy|)\). Due
                    to this fact, the Fourier transformed correlator is proportional to a delta function and only
                    depends on the magnitude of the momentum (i.e. wavevector):
                </p>

                \[
                \langle \phi_{\bfk}\phi_{\bfp}\rangle\equiv\int\rd^{d}x\rd^{d}y\,
                e^{-i\bfk\cdot\bfx-i\bfp\cdot\bfy}\langle \phi(\bfx)\phi(\bfy)\rangle=P(k)\tilde{\delta}^{d}(\bfk+\bfp)
                \]

                <p>
                    We then put a prime on the momentum space correlator to indicate that we’ve dropped the delta
                    function and associated \(2\pi\) factors:
                </p>

                \[
                \langle \phi_{\bfk}\phi_{-\bfk}\rangle'=P(k)
                \]

                <p>
                    We define \(\tilde{\delta}(\bfk+\bfp)\equiv (2\pi)^{d}\delta^{d}(\bfk+\bfp)\) and later use
                    \(\tilde{\bfk}\equiv \bfk/(2\pi)\) to minimize the number of explicit \(2\pi\)’s appearing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Two functional forms of the power spectrum are particularly important: white noise and scale
                    invariant power spectra.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>White Noise:</b> \(P(k)\propto C\) with \(C\) constant. This corresponds to a position space
                    correlator of the form \(\langle \phi(\bfx)\phi(\bfy)\rangle\propto C\delta^{d}(\bfx-\bfy)\), i.e.
                    there are no correlations between fluctuations at separated points if the power spectrum is
                    described by white noise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Scale Invariant:</b> \(P(k)\propto k^{-d}\) in \(d\) spatial dimensions. A scale invariant power
                    spectrum corresponds to fluctuations which have the same correlations no matter how separated the
                    two points are:
                </p>

                \[
                {\rm Scale \ Invariant}\Longleftrightarrow \langle \phi(\lambda\bfx)\phi(\lambda\bfy)\rangle=\langle
                \phi(\bfx)\phi(\bfy)\rangle\ {\rm for \ all} \ \lambda

                <h3> Probability Distributions: Functions and Functionals </h3>

                <p>We now review how probability distributions work for continuous, Gaussian random fields. We start
                    with a brief review of the analogous theory for continuous random variables. </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Probability Distribution Functions (PDF):</b> Given some continuous random variable \(q\), the
                    probability that \(q\) lies in some range \(\rd q\) is given by \(\P(q)\rd q\), where \(\P(q)\) is
                    the PDF. The PDF is normalized as \(\int\P(q)\rd q=1\) and the expectation value of \(q^{n}\) is
                    given by
                </p>

                \[
                \langle q^n\rangle= \int\rd q\, \P(q)q^n
                \]


                <p>
                    The Gaussian PDF is of primary importance. For \(n\) random variables, \(q_i\), the Gaussian PDF
                    takes on the form:
                </p>

                \[
                \P^{\rm Gauss.}(q_1,\ldots,q_n)=\sqrt{\frac{\det
                (A)}{(2\pi)^n}}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}q_iA_{ij}q_j\right]\ ,
                \]

                <p>
                    where \(A_{ij}\) is some positive definite matrix (and sums over repeated indices are implicit). The
                    corresponding Gaussian two-point statistics are then given by:
                </p>

                \[
                \langle q_i q_j\rangle =\left(\prod_{k=1}^{n}\int \rd q_k\right)\P^{\rm
                Gauss.}(\vec{q})q_iq_j=A^{-1}_{ij}
                \]

                <p> where \(A^{-1}_{ij}\) is the inverse of the matrix \(A_{ij}\).</p>

                <p>
                    Probability Distribution <em>Functionals</em> are perhaps less familiar, but they are exactly the
                    same idea as PDFs simply applied to the case of random <em>fields</em> such as \(\phi(\bfx)\),
                    rather than random variables such as \(q_i\). We will only focus on the case of Gaussian functionals
                    whose form and properties are defined in exact analogy to the PDF case. Starting with a position
                    space field \(\phi(\bfx)\), the Gaussian functional \(\P(\phi(\bfx))\) is written as
                </p>

                \[
                {\cal P}[\phi(\bfx)]\propto \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\int\rd^dx\rd^dy\, \phi(\bfy)A(\bfy,\bfz)\phi(\bfz)
                \right]
                \]

                <p>
                    where we have omitted the normalization factor. Correlators are then computed by a path integral
                    over all field values \(\phi(\bfx)\). The outcome of the integral is determined in analogy to the
                    PDF case. For instance, the two-point correlator is:
                </p>

                \[
                \langle \phi(\bfx)\phi(\bfy)\rangle\equiv \int\D\phi\,
                \P[\phi(\bfx)]\phi(\bfy)\phi(\bfz)=A^{-1}(\bfy,\bfz)\ ,
                \]

                <p>
                    where \(A^{-1}(\bfy,\bfz)\) obeys
                </p>

                \[
                \int\rd^dy\, A(\bfx,\bfy)A^{-1}(\bfy,\bfz)=\delta^{d}(\bfx-\bfz)\ .
                \]

                <p>
                    White noise corresponds to the simple case where \(A(\bfx,\bfz)=C\delta^{d}(\bfx-\bfz)\) and so
                    \(A^{-1}(\bfx,\bfz)=\frac{1}{C}\delta^{d}(\bfx-\bfz)\), for instance. Assuming spatial homogeneity
                    and isotropy, it is straightforward to Fourier transform the above formulas in order to derive their
                    momentum space analogues:
                </p>

                \[

                \begin{align}
                \P[\phi_{\bfk}]&\propto \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\int\rd^{d}\tilde{q}\rd^{d}\tilde{p}\,
                \phi_{\bfq}A(q)\tilde{\delta}^{d}(\bfq+\bfp)\phi_{\bfp}\right]\nn
                \langle\phi_{\bfk}\phi_{\bfk'}\rangle&=\frac{\tilde{\delta}^{d}(\bfk+\bfk')}{A(k)}
                \end{align}

                \]

                <p>
                    Clearly, the function \(A(k)\) above is simply the inverse of the power spectrum:
                    \(P(k)=A^{-1}(k)\). By adding terms cubic and higher order in \(\phi_\bfk\) to the exponential in
                    \(\P[\phi_\bfk]\), the distribution is made non-Gaussian. The search for non-Gaussian signatures in
                    Cosmological statistics is part of cutting-edge experimental efforts, but further discussion of
                    these issues falls outside of the scope of this post.
                </p>

                <!-- Implementation -->

                <h2> Implementation</h2>



                <p>
                    We now demonstrate how to generate a realization, given \(P(k)\). We first present the steps to the
                    process and explain the logic. Then we show how to practically implement the steps in
                    <em>Mathematica</em>.
                </p>

                <h3> The Steps</h3>


                <p>
                    A realization of a Gaussian random field with power spectrum can be created via the following steps:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Start with a white noise field with unit amplitude \(\varphi_{\bfk}\) obeying \(\langle
                        \varphi_{\bfk}\varphi_{-\bfk}\rangle'=1\). </li>
                    <li> Generate a position space realization of the white noise, denoted by \(R_{\rm white}(\bfx)\).
                        That is, \(R_{\rm white}(\bfx)\) is a particular map showing the values of \(\varphi\) at
                        various positions \(\bfx\) and for which
                        \(\langle\varphi(\bfx)\varphi(\bfy)\rangle'=\delta^{d}(\bfx-\bfy)\).</li>
                    <li> Fourier transform the realization: \(R_{\rm white}(\bfx)\longrightarrow R_{\rm white}(\bfk)\).
                    </li>
                    <li> Multiply \(R_{\rm white}(\bfk)\) by the square root of the power spectrum to create
                        \(R_P(\bfk)=P^{1/2}(k)R_{\rm white}(\bfk)\).</li>
                    <li> Fourier transform \(R_P(\bfk)\) back to position space to get the desired realization:
                        \(R_P(\bfx)=\int\rd^d \tilde{k}\, e^{i\bfk\cdot\bfx} R_P(\bfx)\).</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The logic behind the above steps is pretty simple. If we’re given a white noise field \(\phi_\bfk\)
                    which has \(\langle \varphi_{\bfk}\varphi_{-\bfk}\rangle'=1\)
                    , then we can create a field with the desired power spectrum simply by defining \(\phi_\bfk\equiv
                    P^{1/2}(k)\varphi_\bfk\). The new field has the desired statistics, by construction.
                </p>



                <p>
                    Therefore, given a realization of the white noise field , we just have to multiply its Fourier space
                    realization by and inverse Fourier transform to get a position space realization of \(\phi(\bfx)\).
                    The above is practical, because making a white noise realization is easy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These steps are idealized, as we’ll have to make the realization on a discrete grid; we won’t be
                    able to work with continuous variables. Practical complications which arise from working on a
                    lattice are covered in the following sections.
                </p>

                <!-- Continuous to Discrete -->

                <h3> From Continuous to Discrete</h3>

                <p>
                    For concreteness, we focus on creating two-dimensional realizations on \(N\times N\) grids, with
                    \(N\) an even number. The generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward. In passing to a
                    lattice, our continuous fields \(\phi(\bfx)\) and \(\phi_\bfk\) are replaced by the discrete
                    quantities \(\phi^{\bfx}_{ab}\) and \(\phi^{\bfk}_{ab}\), respectively, where
                    \(a,b\in\{0,\ldots,N-1\}\). \(\phi^{\bfx}_{ab}\)
                    is the value of the field at the point \((a,b)\) on the grid. The continuous Fourier transform which
                    related \(\phi^{\bfx}_{ab}\) and \(\phi^{\bfk}_{ab}\) is replaced by a discrete one:
                </p>


                \[
                \begin{align}
                \phi^{\bfk}_{ab}&=\sum_{c,d=0}^{N-1}\exp\left(-ix_ck_a-ix_dk_b\right)\phi^{\bfx}_{cd}\nn
                \phi^{\bfx}_{ab}&=\frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{c,d=0}^{N-1}\exp\left(ix_ck_a+ix_dk_b\right)\phi^{\bfk}_{cd}\nn
                \end{align}
                \]

                <p>
                    where \(x_a\equiv a\) and \(k_a\equiv \frac{2\pi a}{N}\). Given real \(\phi^{\bfx}_{ab}\) and even
                    \(N\), \(\phi^{\bfk}_{ab}\) has the following properties
                </p>

                <ul class="color-dot-ul">
                    <li> \(\phi^{\bfk}_{ab}=\phi^{\bfk}_{(a+\alpha N)b}=\phi^{\bfk}_{a(b+\alpha N)}\) for any integer
                        \(\alpha\)</li>
                    <li> \(\phi^{*\bfk}_{ab}=\phi^{\bfk}_{-a-b}\)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The above further imply the following important property:
                    \(\phi^{*\bfk}_{a(N/2+b)}=\phi^{\bfk}_{a(N/2-b)}\) and similar with the other index.
                    and similar with the other index.
                </p>

                <!-- Building a Realization -->

                <h3> Building a Realization</h3>

                <p>
                    Now we walk through the steps involved in actually building a realization in <em>Mathematica</em>.
                </p>

                <h4> White Noise</h4>

                <p>
                    First, we construct a grid of white noise. When passing to the grid, the unit white noise
                    probability distribution functional becomes the following ordinary PDF:
                </p>


                \[
                \P[\varphi(\bfx)]\longrightarrow
                \P[\varphi^{\bfx}_{ab}]=\prod_{c,d=0}^{N-1}\frac{\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\phi^{\bfx}_{cd}\right)^2\right]}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
                \]

                <p>
                    Building a white noise realization is therefore simple: the value of at every grid point is just
                    randomly chosen from a Gaussian distribution. An example of such a realization is shown in Fig. 1
                    below.
                </p>

                <figure class="center">
                    <img src="img/GaussianRealization1024WhiteNoise.png">
                    <figcaption> Fig. 1: A realization of white noise.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    In <em>Mathematica</em>, the white noise array can be generated via:
                </p>

                <pre
                    class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-mma"> WhiteNoise=RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[],{Nsize,Nsize}] </code></pre>

                <p>
                    where <code>Nsize</code> is the size of the grid (<code>Nsize</code>=1024 in Fig. 1).
                    <code>WhiteNoise</code> is our realization \(R_{\rm white}(\bfx)\) and building \(R_{\rm
                    white}(\bfk)\) is very simple: we just pass <code>WhiteNoise</code> through the built-in
                    <code>Fourier</code> function:
                </p>


                <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-mma"> WhiteNoiseFourier=Fourier[WhiteNoise] </code></pre>


                <h4> Constructing the Fourier Realization</h4>

                <p>
                    The Fourier space realization then needs to be multiplied by the square root of the power spectrum.
                    This is subtle, as the resulting field \(\phi^{\bfk}_{ab}\)
                    needs to obey the conditions we derived in the previous section, particularly
                    \(\phi^{*\bfk}_{a(N/2+b)}=\phi^{\bfk}_{a(N/2-b)}\).

                </p>

                <p>
                    This is important because if we did the naive construction and took the white noise realization
                    values \(\varphi^{\bfk}_{ab}\)
                    and simply multiplied by \(P^{1/2}(k)\) with \(k=\frac{2\pi}{ N}\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\) to build
                    \(\phi^{\bfk}_{ab}=P^{1/2}(k)\varphi^{\bfk}_{ab}\), then we'd find
                    \(\phi^{*\bfk}_{a(N/2+b)}\neq\phi^{\bfk}_{a(N/2-b)}\), due to the power spectrum factor.
                    If we then transformed the naive \(\phi^{\bfk}_{ab}\), we would be led to an imaginary
                    \(\phi^{\bfx}_{ab}\). We can get around this issue by building the array \(\Phi^{\bfk}_{ab}\) whose
                    components are given by:
                </p>

                \[
                \Phi^{\bfk}_{ab}=
                \begin{cases}
                P^{1/2}(k)\varphi^{\bfk}_{ab} & a,b\le N/2\\
                P^{1/2}(k)\varphi^{\bfk}_{a(b-N)} & a\le N/2, b>N/2\\
                P^{1/2}(k)\varphi^{\bfk}_{(a-N)b} & a> N/2, b\le N/2\\
                P^{1/2}(k)\varphi^{\bfk}_{(a-N)(b-N)} & a,b> N/2
                \end{cases}
                \]

                <p>
                    In the second line above, the \(k\) in \(P^{1/2}(k)\varphi^{\bfk}_{a(b-N)}\) is evaluated at
                    \(k=\frac{2\pi}{N}\sqrt{a^2+(b-N)^2}\) and similar for other lines.
                    The factors of \(N\) can also be removed in the indices of the \(\varphi^{\bfk}\)'s, using the
                    previously mentioned properties of \(\varphi^{\bfk}\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that these manipulations effectively result in the the \(a,b\) indices running over the values
                    \(\{0,\ldots, N/2,-N/2+1,\ldots\}\), rather than \(\{0,\ldots, N-1\}\). For this reason, it is
                    common (but not entirely universal)
                    to index discrete Fourier transforms with index values running over precisely this set. For
                    instance, <em>Mathematica</em> and <em>NumPy</em> both use this
                    convention.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In the limit \(P(k)\to 1\), Fourier transforming \(\Phi^{\bfk}_{ab}\)
                    yields the original position space white noise realization we started with, \(\varphi^{\bfk}_{ab}\),
                    despite the above manipulations. The position space field
                    is then built via
                </p>

                \[
                \phi^{\bfx}_{ab}=\frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{c,d=0}^{N-1}\exp\left(ix_ck_a+ix_dk_b\right)\Phi^{\bfk}_{cd}\ .
                \]

                <p>
                    This field realizes the desired spectrum. The construction of
                    can be carried out in <em>Mathematica</em> as follows:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li> We first build the vector \(k_a=\frac{2\pi}{N}(0,\ldots, N/2,-N/2+1,\ldots, -1)\) as:
                        <pre
                            class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-mma"> kVector=N[(2π)/Nsize*Join[Range[0,Nsize/2],Range[-Nsize/2+1,-1]]] </code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Next, build the power spectrum function. Take it to be of the power law form: \(P(k)\propto
                        k^{-n}\). Because this \(P(k)\) is divergent at \(k=0\) (assuming \(n>0\)), we will set the
                        value of the power spectrum to zero at this one point. This is implemented in
                        <em>Mathematica</em> as:
                        <pre
                            class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-mma"> PowerLawPowerSpectrum[n_,k_]:= If[k==0,0,1/Abs[k^n]] </code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>We want to evaluate \(P^{1/2}(k)\) at all points \((k_a,k_b)\) with \(k=\sqrt{k_a^2+k_b^2}\).
                        This array is constructed using the <code>Outer</code> command:
                        <pre
                            class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-mma"> sqrtPowerSpectrumArray=Outer[N[Sqrt[PowerLawPowerSpectrum[n,Norm[{##}]]]]&,kVector,kVector] </code></pre>
                        where \(n\) should be replaced by the desired number determining the power law.
                    </li>
                    <li>Finally, we mutiply the \(a,b\) entry of <code>sqrtPowerSpectrumArray</code> by the \(a,b\)
                        entry of <code>WhiteNoiseFourier</code> to get \(\Phi^{\bfk}_{ab}\):
                        <pre
                            class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-mma">PowerSpectrumRealizationFourier=sqrtPowerSpectrumArray*WhiteNoiseFourier </code></pre>
                        Note that the above multiplication is carried out with the <code>Times</code> function, not
                        <code>Dot</code>.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Plotting the Realization</h4>

                <p>
                    Finally, we transform from \(\Phi^{\bfk}_{ab}\longrightarrow \phi^{\bfx}_{ab}\) and plot the result.
                    This is done in a single command as:
                </p>


                <pre
                    class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-mma">MatrixPlot[Re[InverseFourier[PowerSpectrumRealizationFourier]]]  </code></pre>

                <p>
                    Above, the real part of the transform was taken using <code>Re</code> because numerical errors
                    induce tiny imaginary components in the final calculation of \(\phi^{\bfx}_{ab}\).
                    The results of the realization for various power spectra can be seen in Fig. 2.

                    Finally, we present the results of a higher dimensional realization: Fig. 3 is a GIF which shows
